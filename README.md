# EDA_Spark_MovieLens100K
In this project, we had the opportunity to extract powerful insights within Spark for data analytical purposes. In this EDA, I was able to conduct some data inspection focusing on the “Movielens 100k” dataset. Also, some business questions have been posed in order to draft a final report for managers in the analytics department.

## Datasets
There are 3 different datasets that you will find in Kaggle. You will be able to find the original source by clicking in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/vik2012kvs/movielens-case-studyuniversity-of-minnesota. In this repo you will see 2/3 datasets, this is because the "ratings.csv" dataset is too large in capacity to upload in this repo. 

## Dashboard Creation with Google Data Studio
This project sparked my interest to sunsinct all the report findings to an interactive dashboard with the aid of google data studio. This makes the project visually pleasing to digest the data insights immediately.
